# Berted's Toy Programs
A repository of random yet notable toy programs I have made over the years. 

### Stek - `stek.cpp`

A 2D clone of the popular android game, [Stack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stack&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1). Implemented with Windows' console API. Hence, the app can only be compiled on Windows devices to my knowledge.

Made during high school for a school event.

### Type - `type.cpp`

A typing test program. Reads from a text file `database.txt` for its word list. `database.txt` should provide each word in a seperate line. The words should be provided in descending order of most common to least common word. The code assumes there are exactly 10,000 words in `database.txt`, I can't be bothered to modify the code. Type provides four difficulty options,

1. Easy, presents only the top 50 most common words according to `database.txt`.
2. Medium, presents only the top 500 most common words according to `database.txt`.
3. Hard, presents the top 2,500 most common words according to `database.txt`.
4. Extreme, presents all 10,000 words in `database.txt`.
